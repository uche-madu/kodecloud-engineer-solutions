The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple `httpd` web server on all app servers in `Stratos DC`. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.


We already have an `inventory` file under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `jump host`. Write a playbook `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `jump host` itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:


1. Install `httpd` web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.


2. Create a file `/var/www/html/index.html` with content:


`This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!`


3. Using `lineinfile` Ansible module add some more content in `/var/www/html/index`.html file. Below is the content:

`Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!`


Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.


4. The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's user and group `owner` should be `apache` on all app servers.


5. The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's permissions should be `0644` on all app servers.


`Note:` Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
